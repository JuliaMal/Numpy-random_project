To quote an article at MIT’s School of Engineering “if you ask the same question you’ll get the same answer every time.” Another way of saying this is that if you give a computer a certain input, it will precisely follow instructions to produce an output. And if you later give a computer the same input, it will produce the same output. If the input is the same, then the output will be the same. - That's how computer works.\n",

    "Essentially, the behavior of computers is NOT random. This introduces a problem: how can you use a non-random machine to produce random numbers?\n",
    "Computers solve the problem of generating “random” numbers the same way that they solve essentially everything: with an `algorithm`. Computer scientists have created a set of algorithms for creating pseudo-random numbers, called `pseudo-random number generators`. These algorithms can be executed on a computer. As such, they are completely deterministic. However, the numbers that they produce have properties that approximate the properties of random numbers. \n",

    "That is to say, the numbers generated by pseudo-random number generators appear to be random. Even though the numbers they are completely determined by the algorithm, when you examine them, there is typically no discernible pattern.\n",
